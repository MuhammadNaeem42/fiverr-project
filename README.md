# Project Overview
## This project utilizes Flask, TensorFlow, and Postgres to create a web application that performs image classification using a TensorFlow model served via Docker. The predictions and relevant data are stored in a Postgres database.

# Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop (for Windows users)
- Docker Compose
## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Docker**

   - For Windows users, install Docker Desktop.
   - For other platforms, ensure Docker is installed.

2. **Unzip the Project**

3. **Run Docker Services**

   Navigate to the directory containing `docker-compose.yml` and run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d

  - This will create and start the Docker containers for TensorFlow serving and PostgreSQL.

## Setting Up the Database
   Access the PostgreSQL container:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it postgres_db bash

  - Connect to the database:

  ```bash
  psql -U project project

  - Create the project database:

  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE project;

  - Create the predictions table:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE predictions (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    query VARCHAR(255),
    response VARCHAR(255),
    query_time TIMESTAMP,
    response_time TIMESTAMP
);

  - To check the tables:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM predictions;

  - Running the Flask App

## Install the required Python packages:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

  - Run the Flask application:

  ```bash
  python app.py

  - Project Structure
  - Flask App (app.py)

## The Flask application for image classification and database interaction.

  - TensorFlow Serving (docker-compose.yml)

  - Docker Compose file for setting up TensorFlow serving and PostgreSQL.

## Model Files

  - The TensorFlow model files are expected to be present in the ./pets/1 directory.

  - Database (postgres_db)

## The PostgreSQL database container.

  - Custom Network (my_network)

  - A custom Docker network to connect the services.

## Static Files

  - Uploaded images and other static assets are stored in the static directory.

## Using the App

  - Access the application at http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
  - Upload an image for classification.
  - The app will classify the image and store the prediction and relevant data in the database.
